## Design philosophy

Doing something fun and doing something useful!
But that need to be balanced. The great ideas, innovations and new technologis are always welcomed and embraced in Arrow. However that will also bring the risk to the project. In order to do something really useful, we need to need think of below factors.
- Easy to Uses: That is the highest priority of design philosophy. Easy to learn, Easy to understand, and easy to use. 
- Stablility/Security: It is the second highest priority. if the project always has stablitiy and security issues that will impact the confidence of the users as well as our reputations.      
- Performance: Performance is the not the high priority, especially in the early stage of the project. That does not mean it is not important. We just need to make sure the stablity and security firstly, And then make use of innovations technology to enhance the perofrmance step by step 

All in all, in order to provide the stable, security and product quality and at the same time keeping innovations. We will start from the mature technology, and carefully poslish the new technolgy and adopt before use them.

It has great value for us to push the new technolgis to community. That will help us verify the idea, polish the technology. And most important if the new technogiea are accpepted by community. That will bring a lot of attraction and reputation to Arrow project.
